# News-Article-app-using-Delegates-and-Events

create a C# console application that demonstrates the use of delegates and events. You will create a NewsArticle class that represents a news article, a NewsArticleCollection class that represents a collection of news articles, and a console application that uses the NewsArticleCollection class to filter news articles by category and notify subscribers when new articles are added to or removed from the collection.
